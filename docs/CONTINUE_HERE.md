# Continue here

Updated 2026-08-03, end of the planning session.

**READ docs/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md FIRST.** It supersedes the wave notes
below, carries every remaining work package with dependencies and merge order,
and `docs/WORKHORSE_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` is the self-contained prompt that
executes it.

## State at session end

- ALL lanes merged: X, Y and Z are ancestors of HEAD. Every worktree clean,
  every branch merged, no editor running, integration tree clean.
- The batch compile PASSED: fresh DLLs, install matches the repository,
  verify green at 273 registrations / 60 native tools.
- UI slice PASS 20/0 and AI slice PASS 22/0, both run live. Gameplay 16/1.
- UNCOMPILED: nothing. UNRUN despite compiling: the hidden-pin hash fix
  (finding 0z), anim_blueprint_patch, sequence_render_start, the job API,
  materials and level slices as rewritten, and 30 implemented tools that have
  never been run live (RB-6).

## Exact next commands

Launch the editor with Scripts/start-ue4-project.ps1 -Confirm:$false against
D:/Unreal Projects/BridgeInstallTest, wait for session.json, then:

    npm run slice:ui ; npm run slice:ai ; npm run slice:gameplay
    npm run slice:materials ; npm run slice:level
    npm run slice:animation ; npm run slice:cinematics

Then RB-2's last gameplay red, then the RB-6 promotion sweep, per
docs/FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## Paste this into a fresh session

This used to duplicate an execution prompt inline. That copy drifted out of
sync with reality (it described wave five's merge as still pending after wave
A had already merged and compiled) and gave a fresh session wrong first
actions. There is now exactly one paste-able executor prompt, kept current in
one place: **`docs/WORKHORSE_EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`**. Paste that file's content
below its `---` line into a fresh session. It already states the current
state (wave A merged, three of seven slices run) and the correct first
action (relaunch, run all seven slices, then RB-2 and RB-6).

## Merge lessons, do not rediscover these

**Never line-merge `registry.ts`, `mcp-server/src/tools/puerts.ts`, or
`MCPPuerTSBridgeService.h`.** Git factors out the common suffix of two
conflicting hunks, so both sides end mid-declaration and share one tail. A union
closes one and leaves the other open, and it surfaces as an unbalanced brace or
a UHT "Missing '*' in Expected a pointer type" hundreds of lines away.

Graft whole brace-matched units from the lane's own file instead. That recipe is
now `Scripts/merge-lane.mjs`, and its header explains the failure it prevents.

**Also learned:**

- Never dedupe by trimmed line content when unioning code. It eats repeated
  closing braces and corrupts silently.
- The tool-count assertions in `puerts-tools.test.ts` and `compat-tools.test.ts`
  are shared scalars every lane moves. Take the real number from a run.
- `TOOL_INVENTORY.json`, `CAPABILITY_SCOREBOARD.json` and
  `CAPABILITY_PRESERVATION_AUDIT.md` are GENERATED. Regenerate, never merge.
- `bUseUnity = false` is set on MCPBridgePuerTS deliberately. One command per
  .cpp with its own anonymous-namespace helpers collides under a unity build,
  and the collision scales with the number of commands. Do not turn it back on
  without renaming every file-local helper.

## Open defects, highest value first

1. **Capability regression** (lane P): `scene_batch`'s inputs shipped in the
   legacy catalog and did not survive the native migration.
2. **Finding 0q**: `blueprint_member_patch` leaves the Blueprint compiling with
   warnings where a fresh one does not. Lane R is on it.
4. **Compile messages are unreachable.** A caller told `UpToDateWithWarnings`
   cannot find out what the warnings were through any command.
5. **Packaging: source YES, binaries NO.** Lane N ran `-RunUAT` and proved it
   cannot work in 4.27 with an engine citation. The zip installs and compiles;
   it has never been proven to LOAD.
6. **RL-2 is implemented and editor-free proven, but not native-compiled.** An
   unconfigured zip install now derives its pipe from project name and canonical
   path; an ini override still wins. `npm run test:package` passes. The next
   native compile and two-project session proof remain.
